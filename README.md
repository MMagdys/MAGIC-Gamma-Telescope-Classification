# MAGIC-Gamma-Telescope-Classification
the MAGIC gamma telescope dataset:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MAGIC+Gamma+Telescope, it generated to simulate
registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma
telescope using the imaging technique allowing to discriminate statistically the information
caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).

## Classification Algorithms
- Decision Tree
- AdaBoost
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Random Forest
- Logestic Regression
- Na√Øve Bayes
